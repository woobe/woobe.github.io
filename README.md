My Personal Web Site
===============

I have been using [About Me](bit.ly/aboutme_jofaichow) as my personal web page for quite a while. 

It's time to change. I want to have full control of my web contents and have better customisation of the ite layout.

The result is this bootstrap website [http://www.jofaichow.co.uk/](http://www.jofaichow.co.uk/) hosted on GitHub.
